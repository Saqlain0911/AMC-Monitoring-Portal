# Password Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the password security measures implemented in the AMC Portal backend to ensure user passwords are securely stored and verified.

## Implementation Details

### Password Hashing

- **Library**: bcrypt v6.0.0
- **Salt Rounds**: 10 (as specified)
- **Hashing Function**: `bcrypt.hash(password, 10)`

### Registration Process

When a user registers:

1. Password is received in plain text via POST request
2. Password is immediately hashed using `bcrypt.hash(password, 10)`
3. Only the hashed password is stored in the database
4. Plain text password is never stored

```javascript
// Hash password before storing
const saltRounds = 10;
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);

// Store hashed password in database
await database.run(
  `INSERT INTO users (username, password, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)`,
  [username, hashedPassword, ...]
);
```

### Login Verification

When a user logs in:

1. Plain text password is received via POST request
2. User's hashed password is retrieved from database
3. `bcrypt.compare()` is used to verify the password
4. Authentication succeeds only if passwords match

```javascript
// Verify password against stored hash
const passwordMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);

if (!passwordMatch) {
  return res.status(401).json({
    error: "Authentication Failed",
    message: "Invalid username or password",
  });
}
```

## Security Features

### Salt Rounds

- **Current Setting**: 10 rounds
- **Security**: Provides strong protection against rainbow table attacks
- **Performance**: Balanced for production use (fast enough for user experience)

### Password Storage

- ✅ Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before database storage
- ✅ Plain text passwords are never stored in the database
- ✅ Salt is automatically generated and included in the hash
- ✅ Each password gets a unique salt

### Password Verification

- ✅ Uses constant-time comparison via `bcrypt.compare()`
- ✅ Prevents timing attacks
- ✅ Returns consistent error messages for invalid credentials

## Files Involved

- `backend/routes/auth.js` - Registration and login endpoints
- `backend/migrate-mock-data.js` - Mock data migration script
- `backend/package.json` - bcrypt dependency declaration

## Testing Password Security

You can test the implementation:

1. **Registration Test**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"testpass123","email":"test@example.com"}'
   ```

2. **Login Test**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"testpass123"}'
   ```

3. **Database Verification**:
   Check that stored passwords in the database are hashed (not plain text)

## Security Compliance

This implementation follows industry best practices:

- ✅ Uses industry-standard bcrypt library
- ✅ Appropriate salt rounds (10) for security/performance balance
- ✅ Unique salt per password
- ✅ Constant-time password verification
- ✅ No plain text password storage
- ✅ Secure password comparison

## Migration Considerations

All existing mock data has been migrated with properly hashed passwords using the same bcrypt configuration for consistency.
